                    <p>Krishane Patel is a leading behavioural scientist, with a particular interest on decision-making and behaviour. Krishane read Psychology at the University of Warwick and decided to embark on a career in behavioural sciences. Krishane pursued a MRes in Psychological Research Methods from the University of York, where he worked under the world renowned psychologist&nbsp;<a title="Prof.sdfsdf" href="https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/emeritusfaculty/ab50/">Prof. Alan Baddeley</a>. After completing his Masters, Krishane sought after a Research Assistant (voluntary) at Imperial College London under <a href="https://www.wbs.ac.uk/about/person/ivo-vlaev">Prof Ivo Vlaev</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.darzi">Prof Lord Ara Darzi</a>&nbsp;working on behavioural science and decision-making research in contexts of health, finance and politics.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Krishane was offered an ESRC award to pursue doctoral training at one of Europe's leading business schools, <a href="https://www.wbs.ac.uk">Warwick Business School</a>, in the behavioural science group. Krishane led and managed a large-scale randomised controlled trial and was able to instill long-lasting collaborations across Cambridge&nbsp;and Monash University. Krishane's thesis evaluated behavioural interventions to reduce monetary consumption in university students using goal-setting (asking participants to set financial goals to save towards) or behavioural substitutions (swapping a daily coffee for a tea).Krishane thesis was even awarded spin-off funding to launch a larger investigation with adults in social housing.&nbsp;</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Krishane was then offered a presitigous position applying behavioural science in public policy settings as a joint position between University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change and the <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk">Food Standards Agency</a> . Krishane consulted and advised the social science team on aspects of behavioural science practice and research methods. During this time her worked on various research projects involving regulatory practice, allergen, communications, and supply chains.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Currently, Krishane is a Research Fellow at the University of Warwick, he focuses on the intersection between decision-making and behaviour change. In understanding decision-making processes, we can understand and apply these insights to engineer real long-lasting change. Some of the questions his research is trying to answer includes:</p>
                    <br><ul>
                    <li>How can we optimally diagnose and understand the causal mechanisms surrounding an issue?</li>
                    <li>How can we optimise people's decisions day-to-day to maximise long term well-being?</li>
                    <li>Do computational methods have anything to offer in behaviour change?</li>
                    </ul>
