              <p>
                Welcome to my new blog! Thank you for reading this blogpost. I hope you enjoy it and come back for more. I thought I would explain a little about why I have put this post together and what I hope readers can take away from this.</p>
  <br>
                <p>The idea of writing my blogpost: <strong>The Behavioural Clinic</strong> was an idea I have had for some time now. As an academic, I have been lucky to work in fantastic departments and in unique settings such as public-policy. In this time I have accumulated a lot of material, some of it I taught, some of it I practiced. I hope to share some of my wisdoms and practice for others to learn. But I do have an ulterior motive, I want to immortalise some of these ideas and improve my HTML, css and Javascript skills (because why not!).</p>
                <br>
                <p>As you can probably tell by glacing at my CV, I have predominantly lived in the academic world for most of my career. Unfortunately, the academic world is a bit of a bubble, and there are a few posts about this (take a look at Life of a Professor's <a href=" https://www.lifeofaprofessor.com/post/do-academics-live-in-a-bubble"> post </a> on this). The academia bubble has a few issues (which I will not delve into these here) but the main idea is to (partly) practice writing in everyday English rather than verbose academic jargon, but also to hopefully try and bridge the academic-practitioners gap. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I find writing to be really therapeutic but it is very, very hard to write a good academic paper. The standard for academic writing is so high and some (not all) academics write using a lot of jargon that is difficult to follow or understand. So I hope that through this blogpost I can reduce a lot of the jargon from the academic circles. </p>
                <br>
                <p>One of the other things, I hope to do is to share academic findings and ideas for the general people. A place where marketplace of ideas is not locked away behind institutions and fancy titles but available to every person. This may be recent papers, or discussions going on but I think it is important that these ideas come out to practitioners who may not have the funds to pay for access to journals. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I hope that The Behavioural Clinic can develop and grow into this set of expectations. I want to make sure that people learn from this blogpost. I hope that you enjoy travelling on this journey with me and maybe we can grow together.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thank you and happy reading!

            <h2><strong>What is behaviour?</strong></h2>
            <br></div>
            <div class = "content2" style="display:none;">
              <p>I thought I would start this blog with a really simple question, but something people often overlook and even take for granted:</p>
              <br>
              <div class="animated-title">
                <div class="text-top">
                  <div>
                    <span>What is</span>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <div class="text-bottom">
                  <div>behaviour?</div>
                </div>
              </div>              <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
              <p>Before, you close the box, take a moment to consider what this question really mean. Most of us understand behaviour as just an innate thing, behaviour is <i><strong>just</strong></i> "what we do". If we really think about that, that does not make a huge amount of sense. "<i>What we do</i>" is not enough to define behaviour as it applies to pretty much everything and nothing at the same time. If two people are both in the same setting but engaging in completely different behaviour, there feels like a disconnect between </p>
              <br>
              <p>I would ask you to hold your on to your thinking caps because we are about to delve into some strange and less strange ideas! The idea of behaviour is easy to understand when we talk about ourselves, right? In most sentences, the <strong>verb</strong> is the behaviour in question (for example Jonathon is driving to Newcastle). However, this same idea would then mean that the lawmower <strong>mowing</strong> the grass, is also behaving. Inanimate objects hold the ability to behave? </p>

              <p>This is where things can get somewhat peculiar, does a vending machine behave? Can a driverless vehicle behave? Although these entities are not living, the idea that they possess some sort of behaviour does not seem as radical as at first glance. It seems like there is something intrinsic about the idea of behaviour, that behaviour is a general concept and not only limited to living beings. Early models of behaviour were based on notions of <strong>Stimulus</strong>-<strong>Response</strong> models. In such theories, a response is generated with respect to given stimuli, by varying stimulus factors (for example magnitude, number and timing) one can determine the strengths of those stimuli by observing the response. Thorndike's studies are considered some of the cornerstone principles in the history of psychology, and are worthy of further exploration in a future post. For now, we can understand the basics of the stimulus-response model. In this model, inputs are converted to outputs purely from a simple linear perspective of information processing. A loud bang would elicit a survival mechanism to prick up ones ears and engage readiness to fleet in response. In the same manner, internal states of hunger can generate a desire to reach out for fruit resting on the kitchen counter. From this perspective we can argue that:</p>
              <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">Behaviour = &fnof; (stimuli)</p><br>
              <p>Now when you see the above equation, please do not panic. This is the mathematical notation that explains "Behaviour" as a function (<i>f</i>   ) of the different types of stimulus. However, one might say that this explains everything and nothing. The issue here is that this model is said to lack <u><i>parsimony</i></u>, the more parsimonuous something is, the more it can explain in the least amount of terms. In the world of research, theories such as gravitational theory, or the germ theory of disease can be understood as parsimonuous, they explain a great deal but in no more complextiy than it has to be. Another idea that may be more relatable is Occam's razor: "entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity". This is the idea that when presented with two explanations, pick the one that holds the fewest assumptions. In our model, perhaps sound along with circular stimuli can generate behaviour A, but these same stimuli can also generate behaviour B. <br>
              </p><br>
              <p> Maybe we are missing something in this model. If stimuli is the external forces that are acting on a behaviour, perhaps we should be considering internal forces (Lewin, 1936). Lewin, an emminent psychologist suggested a concise model which was depicted as such: <em><br /></em></p><br>
              <p style="text-align: center;">Behaviour = &fnof;(P,E)</p><br>
              <p style="text-align: left;">In this equation, behaviour is the output of the function comprised of internal representation of the agent (<em>P</em>) and the environment (<em>E</em>). In this manner, behaviour can be understood as the result of a process which integrates two systems, an internal and external representation.&nbsp; This model allows us to make two important distinctions:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <ul style="padding: 1rem;">
              <li>The environment can influence our behaivour</li>
              <li>There are internal states that also compete to influence our behaviour</li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>A great metaphor for this model is a rocket. The rocket must navigate its way to the outer atmosphere, by overcoming different environmental factors, where the velocity of the rocket can increase due to reduced atmosphere. The rocket is also dependent on its internal states, such as the amount of fuel, the internal circruity, or even the payload. The interaction of these two sets of states are what determines the rockets behaviour.

              <p class="indent__para">These ideas provide a really helpful benchmark in understanding how factors influence behaviour. These ideas are central to mainstream theories in psychology and the behavioural sciences which we can explore in more detail in a later post. It is important to note how such models integrate the impact of both internal and external states. But this does also tell us a little about how we can change behaviour. We can focus on the environment (approaches such as <strong>nudging</strong>) or we can focus on internal processes (such as cognitive vaccines and cognitive behavioural therapy).</p>

              How can we be sure that an idea is a good one? Is that drug effective? Is this drug better than that drug? These questions all tap into the scientific world of <u><strong>experimentation</strong></u>. This is one of my favourite things to teach because most people think they understand how experiments and hypothesis testing works, but its actually counter-intuitive and a lot of people fall into the same trap, misunderstanding how to compare two these competing ideas.</p><br>
              <p>
              Let's take a look at a really simple experiment. In this experiment, let's say we are interested in whether <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63329233">incentivising energy use at night reduces pressure on the National Grid</a>. This is our <strong><u>hypothesis</u></strong>, our hypothesis is the thing we are interested in. This can be <u>directional</u> or <u>non-directional</u>, but this is fancy academic talk for the hypothesis says there is some idea about how we rank our conditions, or we have no idea whether there is any difference. Directional hypothesis are more common than you might think, and one of the main reasons is that these are more powerful as a statistical test (this means we are more likely to find a result given that it exists). One of the best metaphors of experimental is the "great marketplace of ideas". What you are really doing here is comparing two ideas and seeing how much evidence you have in favour or against one of these ideas. You compare your hypotheses (H<sub>1,2,3...N</sub>) against a comparator or null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>). Now what the null hypothesis entails is up to you, but ideally you dont want to straw-man this issue. The best comparison is current practice (now that may not be anything there but that is also current practice) or otherwise the next best thing. In oncology for instance, it would not really ideal to compare your cancer treatment against no treatment at all. Ideally you write your hypotheses out:<br><br>
            H<sub>0</sub>: There is no difference between the groups.<br>
            H<sub>1</sub>: Incentivising energy usage at night reduces the power usage in day-time.<br>

            <p>
              In our experiment, we have our neutral condition. This is what we compare our idea against. Now, I will come onto this in a later post, but for now we can just think of these ideas battling it out. Your experiment is a relative comparison, it can only tell you whether your idea is better than this other idea, that's it. The degree to which you can trust your results is down to how much systematic bias you can remove. This is academic talk for issues that can make you skeptical about the results. One way to remove systematic bias is to randomise who gets which condition. The purpose of randomisation is that as our sample grows (to the limit of the population), individual attributes are evenly distributed between both groups. So this can be anything like demographic variables such as age, psychological constructs like conscientiousness, or even economic variables like income. But for now we can just flip a coin, there are more "random" ways than others, mainly because some things are never truly random.
            </p><br>
            <p> 
            Each time we come across our unit of randomisation, we flip our coin and use this to determine which group they get allocated to. Now the wise readers amongst you may see that I said <strong>unit of randomisation</strong> and not individuals. That is because there are different experimental models we can use (which I promise I will come onto at a later post), so we may be randomising individuals, but maybe households, businesses or even postcodes. In each case, the principle is same (but our analysis may change) we are randomising our things into our N groups. Usually we evenly split the sample such that each group consists of 1/n of the total sample. In this case, we have two groups, our system-as-usual group where nothing changes, and our treatment, where we incentivise energy use.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              Once we have randomised all our inputs, we run the treatment. It is imperative that everything remains consistent, you do not deviate from the plan unless it is absolutely critical (ethical or legal ramifications aside). Altering the treatment or control invalidates the experiment and you end up introducing a form of bias that skews the results. Once the study is complete, we analyse the results, this is achieved by converting our experimental model into a mathematic model. In this case we have two treatments, and we are interested in knowing whether there is some change in our measure of energy usage. Most of the time, we can analyse using linear models, meaning that we infer a linear relationship between our treatment groups (There are other assumptions that we believe when running linear models but that is best for another time). Written below is a crude model:<br>
              Energy Usage in day <sub>i</sub> = &#946<sub>0</sub> + &#946<sub>1</sub> Treatment<sub>i</sub> + &#949<sub>i</sub><br><br>
              There are a few symbols here, so let me just explain some of this: &#946<sub>0</sub> is our intercept, its where our line intersects the y-axis, in our case we can interpret this as the average level of energy before we add any change from the result of our treatment. &#949 is our error term, in any model there is going to be some discrepancy between predictions and actual values, this deviation is captured in the error term (along with other effects that are not included such as age, household size and so forth).  &#946<sub>1</sub> is our treatment effect, as we mapped our treatment allocation into a numerical, categorical variable (1 if treatment, 0 if control). The result of this translation is as follows, all the control people become removed from this term (as anything * 0 = 0), this leaves only people who recieved the treatment in this term. The <sub>i</sub> is the notation that this model is applied for each unit i, in our case individuals. From these snippets we can actually infer the meaning of the results for our two groups:<br><br> 
              The control group is expressed as &#946<sub>0</sub><br>
              The treatment group is expressed as &#946<sub>0</sub> + &#946<sub>1</sub><br>
              Therefore &#946<sub>1</sub> denotes the magnitudinal difference between the two groups. If our test for this coefficient is significant, then we can determine that with a reasonable estimation, our treatment does reduce energy usage in the day. What this means is that we run a statistical test on our coefficient, when the statistical test reaches a certain value, it can be translated in a p-value. P-values are the probability of accepting that the null hypothesis is true. The smaller the p-value the less likely that this test occurs by chance, and therefore we can say that these differences are significant. 
            </p>
            <p>There you go, that in a nutshell is how you run an experiment</p>

            How many people do we need? That is a difficult question to answer. What you are looking for is the effect-size of your treatment, this is the relative difference between your groups. Larger effect sizes means its easier to find them, which means fewer people (for example, income and political affiliation). Smaller effect sizes are much harder to detect and therefore require larger samples (for example position of a menu item). One the most famous statisticians Jacob Cohen came up with a rough approximation of what could constitute small, medium and large effects (Cohen, 1988).
            </p>
            <div class="table_plot">
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th><u>Effect Size</u></th>
              <th><u>Magnitude</u></th> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Small</td>
              <td>0.2</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Medium</td>
              <td>0.5</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Large</td>
              <td>≥0.8</td> 
            </tr>
          </table>
          The best practice is to identify from similar studies or to run potential pilot experiments. For now we can assume a small effect size of 0.2. How do we calculate this, well its best to use statistical software as I would not recommend calculating by hand! R is a fantastic tool for statistical analysis, but you can also use  <a href = "https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">G*Power</a>.

              <div><p>Behavioural science as a concept has been blossoming over the last ten years. Numerous behavioual insights teams have stemmed across Government institutions and departments (such as HMRC and the Cabinet Office) as well as boutique consulting firms (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://influenceatwork.co.uk">Influence At Work</a>) and even within groups (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/insights/focus/behavioral-economics-public-policy.html">Deloitte</a>). The function of these teams is to use their knowledge of behavioural science to leverage some sense of value. Behavioural science has become a fantastic toolbox for companies and Government departments to reach their goals, but what does that all mean? What is behavioural science and how did it all start? To answer this question we have to rewind a little to some core microeconomic ideas and concepts. </p></div>

            <h4>Utility Maximisation</h4>
            <p>A central tenant of microeconomics is that people act in way to maximise their utility (academic talk for an individual's self-interests). For example, take the below example:<br>
            You are offered two choices, which should you pick?:
          <ol>
            <li>100% chance of winning £10</li>
            <li>10% chance of winning £100 or 90% chance of winning nothing</li>
          </ol>
          Now the wisest amongst you may say option (2), as there is a clear winner. Okay that makes sense but lets explore a second example. Say you are homeless and hungry... which option should you take now:
          <ol>
            <li>100% chance of losing £10</li>
            <li>10% chance of losing £100 or 90% chance of losing nothing</li>
