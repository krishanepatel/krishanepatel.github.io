              Welcome to my new blog! Thank you for reading this blogpost. I hope you enjoy it and come back for more. I thought I would explain a little about why I have put this post together and what I hope readers can take away from this.</p>
<br><br>
              <p>The idea of writing my blogpost: <strong>The Behavioural Clinic</strong> was an idea I have had for some time now. As an academic, I have been lucky to work in fantastic departments and in unique settings such as public-policy. In this time I have accumulated a lot of material, some of it I taught, some of it I practiced. I hope to share some of my wisdoms and practice for others to learn. But I do have an ulterior motive, I want to immortalise some of these ideas and improve my HTML, css and Javascript skills (because why not!).</p>
              <br><br>
              <p>As you can probably tell by glacing at my CV, I have predominantly lived in the academic world for most of my career. Unfortunately, the academic world is a bit of a bubble, and there are a few posts about this (take a look at Life of a Professor's <a href=" https://www.lifeofaprofessor.com/post/do-academics-live-in-a-bubble"> post </a> on this). The academia bubble has a few issues (which I will not delve into these here) but the main idea is to (partly) practice writing in everyday English rather than verbose academic jargon, but also to hopefully try and bridge the academic-practitioners gap. </p>
              <br><br>
              <p>I find writing to be really therapeutic but it is very, very hard to write a good academic paper. The standard for academic writing is so high and some (not all) academics write using a lot of jargon that is difficult to follow or understand. So I hope that through this blogpost I can reduce a lot of the jargon from the academic circles. </p>
              <br><br>
              <p>One of the other things, I hope to do is to share academic findings and ideas for the general people. A place where marketplace of ideas is not locked away behind institutions and fancy titles but available to every person. This may be recent papers, or discussions going on but I think it is important that these ideas come out to practitioners who may not have the funds to pay for access to journals. </p>
              <br><br>
              <p>I hope that The Behavioural Clinic can develop and grow into this set of expectations. I want to make sure that people learn from this blogpost. I hope that you enjoy travelling on this journey with me and maybe we can grow together.</p>
              <br>  <br>            
              <p>Thank you and happy reading!

          <h2><strong>What is behaviour?</strong></h2>
          <br></button>
          <div class = "content2" style="display:none;">
            <p>I thought I would start this blog with a really simple question, but something people often overlook and even take for granted:</p>
            <br><br>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><h2 style = "text-align: center"><strong>What is behaviour?</strong></h2></p>
            <br>
            <p>Before, you close the box, take a moment to consider what this question really mean. Most of us understand behaviour as just an innate thing, behaviour is <i><strong>just</strong></i> "what we do". If we really think about that, that does not make a huge amount of sense. "<i>What we do</i>" is not enough to define behaviour as it applies to pretty much everything and nothing at the same time. If two people are both in the same setting but engaging in completely different behaviour, there feels like a disconnect between </p>
            <br>
            <p>I would ask you to hold your on to your thinking caps because we are about to delve into some strange and less strange ideas! The idea of behaviour is easy to understand when we talk about ourselves, right? In most sentences, the <strong>verb</strong> is the behaviour in question (for example Jonathon is driving to Newcastle). However, this same idea would then mean that the lawmower <strong>mowing</strong> the grass, is also behaving. Inanimate objects hold the ability to behave? </p>

            <p>This is where things can get somewhat peculiar, does a vending machine behave? Can a driverless vehicle behave? Although these entities are not living, the idea that they possess some sort of behaviour does not seem as radical as at first glance. It seems like there is something intrinsic about the idea of behaviour, that behaviour is a general concept and not only limited to living beings. Early models of behaviour were based on notions of <strong>Stimulus</strong>-<strong>Response</strong> models (Thorndike, 1989). In such theories, a response is generated with respect to given stimuli, by varying stimulus factors (for example magnitude, number and timing) one can determine the strengths of those stimuli by observing the response. Thorndike's studies are considered some of the cornerstone principles in the history of psychology, and are worthy of further exploration in a future post. For now, we can understand the basics of the stimulus-response model. In this model, inputs are converted to outputs purely from a simple linear perspective of information processing. A loud bang would elicit a survival mechanism to prick up ones ears and engage readiness to fleet in response. In the same manner, internal states of hunger can generate a desire to reach out for fruit resting on the kitchen counter. From this perspective we can argue that:</p>
            <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Behaviour = &fnof; (stimuli)</p><br>
            <p>Now when you see the above equation, please do not panic. This is the mathematical notation that explains "Behaviour" as a function (<i>f</i>   ) of the different types of stimulus. However, one might say that this explains everything and nothing. The issue here is that this model is said to lack <u><i>parsimony</i></u>, the more parsimonuous something is, the more it can explain in the least amount of terms. In the world of research, theories such as gravitational theory, or the germ theory of disease can be understood as parsimonuous, they explain a great deal but in no more complextiy than it has to be. Another idea that may be more relatable is Occam's razor: "entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity". This is the idea that when presented with two explanations, pick the one that holds the fewest assumptions. In our model, perhaps sound along with circular stimuli can generate behaviour A, but these same stimuli can also generate behaviour B. <br>
            </p><br>
            <p> Maybe we are missing something in this model. If stimuli is the external forces that are acting on a behaviour, perhaps we should be considering internal forces (Lewin, 1936). Lewin, an emminent psychologist suggested a concise model which was depicted as such: <em><br /></em></p><br>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Behaviour = &fnof;(P,E)</p><br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">In this equation, behaviour is the output of the function comprised of internal representation of the agent (<em>P</em>) and the environment (<em>E</em>). In this manner, behaviour can be understood as the result of a process which integrates two systems, an internal and external representation.&nbsp; This model allows us to make two important distinctions:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul style="padding: 1rem;">
            <li>The environment can influence our behaivour</li>
            <li>There are internal states that also compete to influence our behaviour</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A great metaphor for this model is a rocket. The rocket must navigate its way to the outer atmosphere, by overcoming different environmental factors, where the velocity of the rocket can increase due to reduced atmosphere. The rocket is also dependent on its internal states, such as the amount of fuel, the internal circruity, or even the payload.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="indent__para">These ideas provide a really helpful benchmark in understanding how factors influence behaviour. These ideas are central to mainstream theories in psychology and the behavioural sciences which we can explore in more detail in a later post. It is important to note how such models integrate the impact of both internal and external states. But this does also tell us a little about how we can change behaviour. We can focus on the environment (approaches such as <strong>nudging</strong>) or we can focus on internal processes (such as cognitive vaccines and cognitive behavioural therapy).</p>

            How can we be sure that an idea is a good one? Is that drug effective? Is this drug better than that drug? These questions all tap into the scientific world of <u><strong>experimentation</strong></u>. This is one of my favourite things to teach because most people think they understand how experiments and hypothesis testing works, but its actually counter-intuitive and a lot of people fall into the same trap, misunderstanding how to compare two these competing ideas.</p><br>
            <p>
            Let's take a look at a really simple experiment. In this experiment, let's say we are interested in whether <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63329233">incentivising energy use at night reduces pressure on the National Grid</a>. This is our <strong><u>hypothesis</u></strong>, our hypothesis is the thing we are interested in. This can be <u>directional</u> or <u>non-directional</u>, but this is fancy academic talk for the hypothesis says there is some idea about how we rank our conditions, or we have no idea whether there is any difference. Directional hypothesis are more common than you might think, and one of the main reasons is that these are more powerful as a statistical test (this means we are more likely to find a result given that it exists). One of the best metaphors of experimental is the "great marketplace of ideas". What you are really doing here is comparing two ideas and seeing how much evidence you have in favour or against one of these ideas.</p>

          <p>In our experiment, we have our neutral condition. This is what we compare our idea against. Now, I will come onto this in a later post, but for now we can just think of these ideas battling it out. Your experiment is a relative comparison, it can only tell you whether your idea is better than this other idea, that's it. The degree to which you can trust your results is down to how much systematic bias you can remove. This is academic talk for issues that can make you skeptical about the results. One way to remove systematic bias is to randomise who gets which condition. There are more "random" ways than others, mainly because some things are never truly random. But for now we can just flip a coin.
