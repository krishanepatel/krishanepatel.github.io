                                            Behavioural economics is gaining considerable traction in Government
                                            departments across the world as well as the private sector. There are now
                                            over 300 Behavioural Science units worldwide, and the number is growing (see
                                            the <a href="https://oecd-opsi.org/bi-units/"
                                                style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 600;">full
                                                listing by the OECD</a>). Behavioural economics emerged as the
                                            intersection of economics and the cognitive sciences. It applies
                                            psychological and cognitive descriptions of behaviour to normative models to
                                            explain departures from axiomatic (self-evident or unquestioning)
                                            principles. Unfortunately, many economic models assume individuals are
                                            self-interested, consistently rational, and utility-maximising, but
                                            empirical research suggests this is not always the case. Instead, cognitive
                                            biases and heuristics provide psychological explanations for these model
                                            failures. As a result, biases have become integral to behavioural
                                            economics.<br><br>
                                            Biases represent systematic errors in information processing, often leading
                                            to sub-optimal outcomes. Identifying biases has greatly improved our
                                            understanding of why individuals do not always make optimal choices. The
                                            introduction of psychological mechanisms into economic theory has
                                            significantly enhanced our comprehension of behaviour and decision-making.

                                            behavioural interventions (Thaler & Benartzi, 2004), help investors choose
                                            portfolios that align with their risk tolerance (Benartzi & Thaler, 2001),
                                            and improve decision-making in healthcare contexts using behavioural
                                            insights (Loewenstein, Brennan, & Volpp, 2007).

                                    Information processing theory provides a framework for understanding how the human
                                    brain handles information. Decision-making is an executive function, requiring
                                    constituent processes to work together to generate an outcome. This theory suggests
                                    that cognitive processes can be understood in terms of how information is perceived,
                                    encoded, processed, stored, and retrieved, akin to a computer system. Issues in
                                    processing occur due to limited cognitive capacity or where the assumptions of such
                                    processing are disrupted. Attention, as a finite resource, allocates cognitive
                                    resources to selected information at the cost of neglecting others. For example,
                                    engaging in a highly stimulating conversation on a mobile phone while driving (even
                                    hands-free) impairs performance to a degree equivalent to driving under the
                                    influence of alcohol (blood-alcohol level of 0.07 - 0.1; Leung, Croft, Jackson,
                                    Howard & McKenzie, 2012).
                                    <br><br>
                                    Cognitive biases stem from underlying systematic errors in information processing.
                                    These errors may be bottom-up, emerging from specific cognitive constraints, or
                                    top-down, arising from limited or incomplete information. As a result, when
                                    individuals act in ways that are not in their best interest or fail to make the most
                                    optimal choice, the resulting behaviour is often described as a cognitive bias, such
                                    as loss aversion, ambiguity aversion, and mental accounting.<br>
                                    <br>These all seem like systematic issues so why should researchers and
                                    practitioners
                                    not be using biases so much? The answer is that cognitive biases are
                                    <strong>not</strong> mechanisms, they are in fact
                                    <strong><em>descriptions</em></strong>
                                    of behaviour. A bias can not tell you what has happened and why, it cannot explain
                                    nor
                                    can it even produce behaviour.
                                <h1 class="quote"><em>Cognitive biases are not
                                        mechansism, they are in fact
                                        descriptions of behaviour </em></h1>
                                Despite their prevalence, cognitive biases are not mechanisms but rather descriptive
                                labels for behaviour. A bias cannot explain the cause of an observed behaviour nor
                                determine the underlying cognitive process at play. Instead of treating biases as
                                explanatory constructs, practitioners and researchers should focus on mechanismsâ€”the
                                fundamental processes that generate behaviour.

                                Consider aversion behaviour, such as the so-called ostrich effect, where individuals
                                avoid exposure to negative information. While the ostrich effect describes the observed
                                aversion, the mechanism driving this behaviour is operant conditioning, where avoidance
                                of negative information is reinforced. By referring directly to the mechanisms involved,
                                researchers and practitioners can provide more precise explanations for observed
                                behaviours. A similar approach is being led by Prof Susan Michie at the Centre for
                                Behaviour Change in the <a href="https://www.humanbehaviourchange.org/">Human Behaviour
                                    Change Project</a>,
                                which looks at behaviour change techniques.
                                <br><br>
                                There are many biases that align with similar behavioural outcomes. For example,
                                anchoring and the primacy effect both demonstrate a disproportionate weighting of
                                initial information, yet they arise from completely separate mechanisms. Similarly, risk
                                aversion and loss aversion both stem from aversive mechanisms, but in slightly different
                                constructsâ€”loss aversion refers to avoiding a reduction in value, whereas risk aversion
                                involves aversion to probabilistic uncertainty. However, both likely emerge from similar
                                underlying cognitive processes.

                                    questions over their validity. Let us consider the topic of loss aversion, despite
                                    its foundational status in
                                    behavioral economics, faces serious challenges to its validity as a stable cognitive
                                    bias. Recent research reveals several key problems. First, experimental evidence for
                                    loss aversion has proven highly inconsistent. While Kahneman and Tversky's original
                                    work (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) suggested people universally weigh losses more
                                    heavily than gains,
                                    subsequent studies by Gal and Rucker (2018) and Ert and Erev (2013) found that this
                                    effect varies dramatically based on context and often disappears entirely in dynamic
                                    decision-making environments. These findings raise troubling questions about the
                                    methodology of early behavioral economics research and suggest that many of its
                                    foundational assumptions may need to be reevaluated. The field's heavy reliance on
                                    one-shot experiments with small samples may have created an artificially
                                    narrow view of human decision-making.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This connects to the broader replication crisis in
                                    psychology, where many supposedly robust cognitive biases have failed to replicate
                                    under more rigorous conditions (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2011). Just as famous
                                    effects like ego depletion (Hagger et al., 2016) and power posing (Ranehill et al.,
                                    2015; Garrison et al., 2016) have crumbled under replication attempts, loss aversion
                                    appears increasingly questionable when tested across different contexts and
                                    populations. This pattern suggests we may need to fundamentally rethink how we
                                    conceptualize and study human
                                    decision-making processes. The very notion of stable, universal cognitive biases may
                                    be more reflective of our desire for simple explanations than the complex reality of
                                    human cognition.

                                    The disparity between experimental displays of cognitive biases and their practical
                                    implications in real-world scenarios is notably illustrated by the phenomenon of
                                    default effects. Johnson and Goldstein (2003) showcased the
                                    significant influence of default options on organ donation choices within controlled
                                    environments. This led to considerable excitement regarding the
                                    potential of defaults to influence critical social results. Their research
                                    demonstrated that simply changing the default from "opt-in" to "opt-out" could
                                    significantly increase organ donation rates, a result that seemed to provide an
                                    elegant solution to organ shortages worldwide.
                                    <br><br>
                                    However, the translation of these lab findings into practical healthcare outcomes
                                    has proved to be significantly nuanced. A comprehensive review carried out by
                                    Arshad, Anderson, and Sharif (2019) looked at actual organ donation rates in the
                                    real world and found no significant difference between countries with opt-in versus
                                    opt-out systems. Such stark differences between laboratory and field findings
                                    suggest that any robust effects of defaults found in a controlled setting probably
                                    will be overpowered by some other factors of complex real-world settings, which
                                    might include those from cultural norms, religious beliefs, family, and
                                    characteristics of the healthcare systems.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The problem whereby laboratory results fail to find meaningful translation to
                                    real-world applications is by no means limited to organ donation defaults. Similar
                                    gaps have been observed in numerous domains in which behavioral interventions based
                                    on cognitive biases have been implemented. While the laboratory experiments
                                    consistently show clear and large effects, these very same interventions commonly
                                    produce smaller, inconsistent, or null effects when implemented in applied settings
                                    (DellaVigna, S., & Linos, 2022; Hummel & Maedche, 2019; Osman et al, 2020).
                                    This indicates that the contrived conditions in which demonstrations of the
                                    cognitive biases are most striking simultaneously make them very bad predictors of
                                    what will happen in natural environments.

                                    Cognitive biases are often conceptualised as part of a unified framework explaining
                                    systematic deviations from rational decision-making. However, they originate from
                                    fundamentally different cognitive mechanisms. Some biases arise due to incomplete or
                                    missing information, prompting individuals to rely on heuristics in response to
                                    uncertainty rather than as a result of inherent irrationality (Tversky & Kahneman,
                                    1974). Others function as heuristics themselvesâ€”evolved mental shortcuts that are
                                    generally adaptive but may appear biased in controlled experimental settings
                                    (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). Meanwhile, certain biases are better understood
                                    through attentional mechanisms, where disproportionate focus on particular
                                    information distorts judgement (Yechiam & Hochman, 2013). This creates a lack of
                                    <em>coherence</em> because it conflates multiple types of cognitive phenomena (such
                                    as cognitive biases and heuristics) under a single conceptual umbrella.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This variation raises concerns about the theoretical coherence of biases
                                    as a category, as well as whether they genuinely represent cognitive errors or are
                                    instead context-dependent adaptations (Gigerenzer, 2018). The tendency to group all
                                    deviations from classical economic rationality under the label of "biases" risks
                                    obscuring the underlying diversity of cognitive processes that drive
                                    decision-making. While some biases represent genuine systematic errors, others
                                    reflect ecologically rational strategies that help individuals make effective
                                    decisions under uncertainty (Todd & Gigerenzer, 2012).
                                    <br><br>
                                    Rather than treating biases as fixed distortions, behavioural science would benefit
                                    from adopting a mechanism-based approachâ€”one that classifies biases according to
                                    their underlying cognitive processes rather than subsuming them under a broad
                                    behavioural economics framework (Lieder & Griffiths, 2020). Many so-called biases
                                    are not inherently irrational. Instead, they reflect adaptive strategies optimised
                                    for specific environments, meaning their effects vary depending on context (Todd &
                                    Gigerenzer, 2012). The observed variability of biasesâ€”for instance, the fact that
                                    loss aversion manifests in some situations but not othersâ€”suggests that a universal
                                    model of human decision-making is inadequate (Gal & Rucker, 2018).
                                    <br><br>
                                    By shifting focus from categorising biases to examining the mechanisms driving
                                    behaviour, researchers and practitioners can develop a more precise and predictive
                                    framework for decision-making. This approach helps reduce the risk of oversimplified
                                    or misapplied interventions (Hertwig & GrÃ¼ne-Yanoff, 2017). Instead of treating
                                    biases as flaws in reasoning, we should view them as part of a broader cognitive
                                    system that balances efficiency and accuracyâ€”one that is shaped by evolutionary
                                    pressures and environmental constraints.

                                    Critiquing cognitive biases does not mean we should discard them altogether. These
                                    biases have played a crucial role in reshaping economic and psychological models,
                                    demonstrating the ways in which human decision-making deviates from classical
                                    notions of rationality (Kahneman, 2011; Thaler, 2015). However, as behavioural
                                    science continues to evolve, it is essential to adopt a more nuanced perspectiveâ€”one
                                    that recognises that cognitive biases are not mechanisms in themselves but
                                    descriptions of behaviour arising from underlying cognitive processes (Gigerenzer,
                                    2018; Lieder & Griffiths, 2020). Instead of treating biases as fixed distortions,
                                    the focus should be on understanding the mechanismsâ€”whether attentional, heuristic,
                                    or information-basedâ€”that generate these effects. Only by doing so can behavioural
                                    insights be applied effectively, ensuring that interventions are based on causal
                                    mechanisms rather than surface-level patterns (Hertwig & GrÃ¼ne-Yanoff, 2017).
                                    <br><br>
                                    At the same time, it is crucial to guard against oversimplification and
                                    misapplication. As behavioural science gains increasing influence in policymaking,
                                    business, and technology, there is a growing temptation to rely on readily
                                    accessible lists of biases as though they represent universally applicable truths
                                    (Felsen & Reiner, 2015; Osman et al., 2020). However, identifying a bias is only the
                                    starting point; it does not necessarily lead to a deeper understanding of human
                                    behaviour. Effective behavioural interventions, like all scientific
                                    applications, require rigour, empirical validation, and adaptability (DellaVigna &
                                    Linos, 2022). By focusing on underlying mechanisms, avoiding oversimplification, and
                                    applying behavioural insights with nuance and precision, we can maximise their
                                    impact (Marchiori, Adriaanse, & De Ridder, 2017).
