                <div class = "panel" style="display:none;">
                <p>Vector space models are trained on very large natural language text corpora, and have large vocabularies, which can be used to make predictions regarding judgments of word similarity, word association and word priming, recall times and reading times. These model predictions have been shown to hold high accuracy and reliability (Jones, Willits, & Dennis, 2015). In this case, we can use vector space models to predict associative judgements in decision-making research. We apply these vector space models to explore the associative judgements of fictional candidates to predict racial disparities.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Research of racial discrimination in labour market experiments is a commonly upheld phenomena, where blinded CV experiments highlight a favourability for white candidates over candidates from other ethnicities (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2004), despite identical CV’s. In this study, we ask participants to rate a simulated short CV for fictional candidates and we compare the judgement ratings against the similarity score based on semantic-embeddings.</p>

              <br></button>
              <div class = "panel" style="display:none;">
                <p>To reduce transmission of COVID-19, public mandates recommended or required minimum physical distancing between individuals, in addition to the use of vaccine rollouts as a public health measure. When individuals are faced with multiple risk reducing behaviours, they may engage in risk compensation. In an online natural experiment, risk compensation was investigated during the COVID-19 pandemic to examine whether vaccination and beliefs in vaccine efficacy reduced physical distancing. Participants completed a distance matching task, where they position avatars of themselves in hypothetical stylized images of everday scenarios in a 2 (location) x 3 (activity) factorial design. Consistent with risk compensation, this study finds that individuals are more willing to stand closer to strangers when fully vaccinated as vaccine beliefs grow. Furthermore, such behaviours do not mitigate when controlling for percieved risk of a COVID-19 infection or hospitalisation. A similar finding is observed for vaccine intentions as well as a difference between revealed and stated preferences of risk when comparing across vaccine manufacturers. These results suggest that though vaccines can be effective as a public health measure, the act of being vaccinated may lead to risk compensation that could lead to additional waves from mutations of any such public health crisis.

I investigate whether computational methods are useful in behaviour change and in areas where they have value, review how they can be used.</p>

            <div class = "panel" style="display:none;">  <p>In this study I explore how impulsive mechanisms of behaviour and executive function are influenced by goal-directed learning through the Stop Signal Task, the N-back task and a Markov decision task. I investigate how global deficits in goal goal-directedness can impair cogntive control.</p>
