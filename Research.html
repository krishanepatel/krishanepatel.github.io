              <div class = "content" style="display:none;">
              <p>Vector space models are trained on very large natural language text corpora, and have large vocabularies, which can be used to make predictions regarding judgments of word similarity, word association and word priming, recall times and reading times. These model predictions have been shown to hold high accuracy and reliability (Jones, Willits, & Dennis, 2015). In this case, we can use vector space models to predict associative judgements in decision-making research. We apply these vector space models to explore the associative judgements of fictional candidates to predict racial disparities.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Research of racial discrimination in labour market experiments is a commonly upheld phenomena, where blinded CV experiments highlight a favourability for white candidates over candidates from other ethnicities (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2004), despite identical CV’s. In this study, we ask participants to rate a simulated short CV for fictional candidates and we compare the judgement ratings against the similarity score based on semantic-embeddings.</p>

              <div class = "content" style="display:none;"><p>Risk aversion is common finding within psychological research of decision-making, however, an interesting finding is that as people find themselves in safer environments they will often engage in more risky behaviour. For example, several research teams found that the introduction of anti-lock brakes caused drivers to drive faster, follow closer and brake later leading to more crashes (). In this study, we use an online distance-matching task to ask participants to move an avatar of themselves to suggest how far they would be willing to be in proximity to another individual in a variety of settings. </p>
