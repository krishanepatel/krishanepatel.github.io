              Welcome to my new blog! Thank you for reading this blogpost. I hope you enjoy it and come back for more. I thought I would explain a little about why I have put this post together and what I hope readers can take away from this.</p>
<br>
              <p>The idea of writing my blogpost: <strong>The Behavioural Clinic</strong> was an idea I have had for some time now. As an academic, I have been lucky to work in fantastic departments and in unique settings such as public-policy. In this time I have accumulated a lot of material, some of it I taught, some of it I practiced. I hope to share some of my wisdoms and practice for others to learn. But I do have an ulterior motive, I want to immortalise some of these ideas and improve my HTML, css and Javascript skills (because why not!).</p>
              <br>
              <p>As you can probably tell by glacing at my CV, I have predominantly lived in the academic world for most of my career. Unfortunately, the academic world is a bit of a bubble, and there are a few posts about this (take a look at Life of a Professor's <a href=" https://www.lifeofaprofessor.com/post/do-academics-live-in-a-bubble"> post </a> on this). The academia bubble has a few issues (which I will not delve into these here) but the main idea is to (partly) practice writing in everyday English rather than verbose academic jargon, but also to hopefully try and bridge the academic-practitioners gap. </p>
              <br>
              <p>I find writing to be really therapeutic but it is very, very hard to write a good academic paper. The standard for academic writing is so high and some (not all) academics write using a lot of jargon that is difficult to follow or understand. So I hope that through this blogpost I can reduce a lot of the jargon from the academic circles. </p>
              <br>
              <p>One of the other things, I hope to do is to share academic findings and ideas for the general people. A place where marketplace of ideas is not locked away behind institutions and fancy titles but available to every person. This may be recent papers, or discussions going on but I think it is important that these ideas come out to practitioners who may not have the funds to pay for access to journals. </p>
              <br>
              <p>I hope that The Behavioural Clinic can develop and grow into this set of expectations. I want to make sure that people learn from this blogpost. I hope that you enjoy travelling on this journey with me and maybe we can grow together.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Thank you and happy reading!
