                                                were shown to distance more as their beliefs grew. In addition, the

                                            During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide implemented various
                                            policies to
                                            reduce transmission and protect health systems and vulnerable populations,
                                            such as
                                            the elderly and immunocompromised (Kadambari, Klenerman, & Pollard, 2020;
                                            Mikolai,
                                            Keenan, & Kulu, 2020; Rout, 2020). While specific measures varied, the core
                                            strategy
                                            was to delay the virus's impact until a vaccine could be rolled out on a
                                            mass scale
                                            (Kissler et al., 2020; Riel & Wit, 2020). Common preventive policies
                                            included social
                                            distancing and mask mandates, driven by evidence showing that new
                                            information and
                                            altered risk perceptions can change behavior (Gaube, Lermer, & Fischer,
                                            2019; Wise
                                            et al., 2020). Governments encouraged remote work, limited social
                                            gatherings, and
                                            mandated physical distancing, with some regions mandating mask usage earlier
                                            than
                                            others. For instance, mask use in the UK was mandated from June 2020 (Murphy
                                            et al.,
                                            2021), while countries like Austria and Indonesia enforced vaccine mandates
                                            due to
                                            issues with vaccine hesitancy (Soares et al., 2021).
                                            <br><br>
                                            Vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca, and Moderna initially
                                            showed
                                            high efficacy in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization
                                            (Pilishvili et al., 2021; Sadoff et al., 2021; Voysey et al., 2021).
                                            However, the
                                            emergence of variants like Delta and Omicron reduced vaccine efficacy,
                                            leading to
                                            concerns about increased transmission even among vaccinated individuals
                                            (Riemersma
                                            et al., 2022; Buchan et al., 2022). As vaccine efficacy declined,
                                            alternative public
                                            health measures like social distancing and mask usage remained essential.
                                            The
                                            combination of these factors sometimes led to risk compensation, a
                                            phenomenon where
                                            individuals adjust their behavior based on perceived lower risks,
                                            potentially
                                            increasing overall risk (Peltzman, 1975; Underhill, 2013).
                                            <br><br>
                                            Risk compensation has been studied in various contexts, such as seatbelt
                                            use, HIV
                                            prevention, and contraception (Evans & Graham, 1991; Eaton & Kalichman,
                                            2007;
                                            Shukla, Pullabhotla, & Arends-Kuenning, 2021). In the context of COVID-19,
                                            there is
                                            mixed evidence regarding risk compensation behaviors. Some studies, such as
                                            Luckman
                                            et al. (2021), show that mask mandates led to reduced social distancing,
                                            while other
                                            research, like Buckell et al. (2021), found evidence of risk compensation
                                            after
                                            vaccination. However, the phenomenon is not universal, with some research
                                            showing no
                                            significant risk compensation, such as a study on Taiwanese healthcare
                                            workers (Sun
                                            et al., 2022). Theoretical frameworks, like the Social Amplification of Risk
                                            Framework (Kasperson et al., 1988), help explain how risk perceptions are
                                            shaped by
                                            competing signals, which can lead to changes in behavior across different
                                            contexts.
                                            <br><br>
                                            To investigate this hypothesis, an online natural experiment was ran
                                            recruiting individuals from the United States to take part in a distance
                                            preference task, evaluating population differences between vaccine status in
                                            conjunction with demographic factors and strength of belief in the vaccine
                                            as well as perceived risk.

                                    Participants were paid 0.70c to complete the experiment (at a rate of
                                    $8.40/hour).

                                    My research reveals that belief in the COVID-19 vaccine has a differential
                                    effect on
                                    social distancing, depending on an individual’s vaccination status. For
                                    fully
                                    vaccinated individuals, stronger belief in the vaccine was associated with a
                                    reduction in social distancing. Conversely, partially vaccinated and
                                    unvaccinated
                                    individuals exhibited increased distancing as their belief in the vaccine's
                                    efficacy
                                    grew. These differing responses suggest important behavioural implications,
                                    particularly at the extremes of belief. See below in
                                    <a href="#vaccineBeliefChart">Figure 2</a>.

                                    The contrast in social distancing behaviour between vaccinated and
                                    unvaccinated
                                    individuals becomes more evident when examined side by side. Pairwise
                                    comparisons
                                    between the groups uncovered significant differences.

                                    For instance, fully vaccinated individuals with weaker beliefs in the
                                    vaccine
                                    maintained a greater physical distance from others, standing approximately
                                    2.15
                                    metres away. On the other hand, partially vaccinated individuals with
                                    similarly weak
                                    beliefs stood much closer, around 0.68 metres—indicating a noticeable
                                    difference in
                                    perceived risk or precautionary behaviour. Unvaccinated individuals with
                                    weaker
                                    vaccine beliefs fell in between, keeping a distance of approximately 1.11
                                    metres.

                                    However, when belief in the vaccine was strong, the pattern shifted. Fully
                                    vaccinated individuals stood slightly closer, at about 1.89 metres.
                                    Meanwhile, both
                                    partially vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals increased their distancing
                                    significantly, standing at 2.38 metres and 2.36 metres, respectively.
                                    <br><br>
                                    These results highlight the complex role vaccine beliefs play in shaping
                                    social
                                    behaviour, regardless of vaccination status. Fully vaccinated individuals
                                    with high
                                    confidence in the vaccine may feel a greater sense of security, which in
                                    turn leads
                                    them to reduce their social distancing. In contrast, partially vaccinated
                                    and
                                    unvaccinated individuals who strongly believe in the vaccine appear to take
                                    additional precautions, likely due to a heightened awareness of their
                                    incomplete or
                                    absent protection.

                                    In summary, it is not just vaccination status that determines social
                                    distancing
                                    behaviour; belief in the vaccine's effectiveness also plays a pivotal role.
                                    This
                                    suggests that public health strategies should address both vaccination
                                    status and
                                    belief systems to effectively guide behaviour and reduce the spread of
                                    COVID-19.

                                    An interesting aspect of the study explored people’s perceptions of how
                                    common
                                    different vaccine statuses (fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, or
                                    unvaccinated)
                                    are within the population. The analysis revealed that individuals tend to
                                    overestimate the prevalence of their own vaccination status, a phenomenon
                                    known as
                                    egocentric bias.
                                    <br><br>
                                    For instance, fully vaccinated individuals estimated that 42.61% of the
                                    population
                                    was also fully vaccinated, significantly higher than the estimates provided
                                    by
                                    partially vaccinated individuals (34.57%) and unvaccinated individuals
                                    (33.47%).
                                    Unvaccinated individuals
                                    displayed the same bias, estimating that 42.82% of the population was
                                    unvaccinated,
                                    while fully vaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals provided much
                                    lower
                                    estimates. A
                                    similar pattern emerged among partially vaccinated participants, who
                                    estimated a greater proportion of the population shared their status,
                                    compared to
                                    lower
                                    estimates from the other groups.
                                    This egocentric bias suggests that people tend to see their own vaccination
                                    status as the norm, which could influence how different groups interpret
                                    public

                                    distancing behavior associated with COVID-19 vaccination status and beliefs
                                    in
                                    vaccine efficacy. While not implying causation, the results suggest that
                                    individuals' vaccination status and their beliefs about vaccine
                                    effectiveness are
                                    associated with distinct patterns of distancing behavior.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Among fully vaccinated individuals, stronger belief in the vaccine’s

                                    correlates with reduced social distancing, potentially reflecting a sense of
                                    security. In contrast, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals
                                    with strong
                                    beliefs in vaccine efficacy tend to increase their distancing behaviors,
                                    possibly
                                    due to an awareness of incomplete or absent vaccination protection. These
                                    patterns
                                    highlight varying responses across groups, suggesting that vaccine beliefs
                                    interact

                                    Additionally, the observed egocentric bias, where individuals tend to

                                    the prevalence of their own vaccination status, suggests that people may
                                    interpret
                                    public health messages through the lens of their perceived majority status.

                                    could influence how different groups respond to public health efforts.

                                        This study underscores the complex relationship between vaccine beliefs,
                                        vaccination status, and social distancing behaviors.
                                        The findings reveal that stronger belief in vaccine efficacy leads to varied
                                        behavioral responses:

                                            Fully vaccinated individuals tend to reduce social distancing as their
                                            confidence in vaccine efficacy grows,

                                        the prevalence of their own vaccination status within the population. This bias
                                        could influence how people interpret

                                        The findings emphasize the need for tailored communication strategies that

                                        Public health messaging should clarify that vaccination complements, rather than
                                        replaces, social distancing measures.
                                        Such clarity can mitigate the potential for risk compensation, particularly in
                                        the face of highly transmissible variants
                                        like Delta and Omicron.
