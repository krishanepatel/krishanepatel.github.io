                                            Effectively managing your savings is key to achieving financial security and
                                            reaching your financial goals. In today's complex financial environment,
                                            there are
                                            various types of savings accounts to support customers, each with their own
                                            advantages and disadvantages. In this post, we delve into <strong>tiered
                                                interest savings accounts</strong>, exploring how they can be used to
                                            maximize
                                            interest, while shedding light on the psychological mechanisms that
                                            can influence your financial decisions, negatively impacting your savings
                                            outcomes.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Tiered savings accounts offer varying interest rates based on the amount
                                            deposited. Typically, these accounts offer higher interest rates for
                                            greater
                                            balances (though some exist that offer lower interest rates for higher
                                            balances), meaning the more money you save, the more you can earn. This
                                            structure creates a powerful incentive for consumers to try and put aside
                                            more each month into a savings account.<br><br>

                                <h3 class="subtitle">Savings goals</h3>
                                <p class="text">Many retail banks offer customers the opportunity to
                                    nominate their savings towards a financial goal. This has been
                                    shown to
                                    significantly promote savings for
                                    consumers (Changwony, Campbell & Tabner, 2021; Soman & Zhao, 2011).
                                    Setting savings goals is valuable to customers
                                    because it provides a structured and organized approach to financial
                                    management. By clearly defining specific objectives, such as saving
                                    for
                                    a vacation, an emergency fund, or a major purchase, this creates an outcome goal, to
                                    which they can identify a path and set of actions they need to take (action
                                    planning). For example, to save for my holiday, <em>I need to save £2000 over a
                                        four
                                        month period (meaning I need £500/month). To do this I have to review my
                                        spending
                                        every
                                        week, identify areas to cut back on (such as takeaways) and put money aside into
                                        a
                                        savings account.</em>
                                    Action planning has been empirically shown to help customers to reach their savings
                                    goal (Patel,
                                    2018).<br><br>
                                    In most retail banks, customers can open multiple instant access savings accounts
                                    and can assign them to unique goals. The central idea is that would allow customers
                                    to
                                    gain a sense of control over their finances and build wealth.

                                <h3 class="subtitle">Multiple accounts: A double edged sword</h3>
                                <p class="text">On the surface, opening multiple savings accounts for different goals
                                    seems like a practical and organized approach. Many financial institutions encourage
                                    consumers to open separate accounts for various objectives such as vacations, home
                                    renovations, or emergency funds. While this method offers psychological benefits, it
                                    can also lead to suboptimal financial outcomes due to how we perceive and manage our
                                    money.
                                    <br><br>
                                    When we create financial categories, we infer what is known as coherence, making
                                    sure that each category has little overlap with each other. For example we do not
                                    think of any overlap between types of cars and bicycles. In financial contexts, how
                                    we mentally
                                    categorise concepts has been empirically shown to
                                    lead individuals astray, and is referred to as
                                    <em>mental accounting</em> (Thaler, 1999). Mental accounting refers to the way
                                    individuals
                                    categorize and treat categories of using money, (for example buying and selling) as
                                    well as different types of spending (such as bills, work and even socialising). In
                                    reality, all money is interchangeable (the technical term is fungible).
                                    <br><br>
                                    For example, a person
                                    might have an account specifically for a holiday and another for a home renovation,
                                    treating the money in these accounts as entirely separate. While this may create a
                                    sense of control and structure, it can actually lead to poor financial
                                    outcomes. By splitting
                                    savings across accounts, consumers could miss out on opportunities to maximize their
                                    interest earnings when interest rates are tiered.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In savings context, this could lead to a situation where a customer focuses on how
                                    they categorize
                                    their saving goals rather than how they allocate money to optimise returns.

                                <h3 class="subtitle">The Matching Heuristic</h3>
                                <p class="text"> When customers are faced with multiple
                                    baskets, many individuals engage in a matching heuristic (Bernatzi &
                                    Thaler, 2001; Gathergood et al., 2019). The matching heuristic is a
                                    mental shortcut in which we allocate resources based on proportions rather than
                                    absolute amounts. For example Gathergood et al (2019) demonstrated that when
                                    repaying multiple credit cards, individuals do not prioritise the card with the
                                    highest interest rate, but instead repay both cards proportionally. Suppose a
                                    customer had two cards, card A with £500 credit and card B with £125 credit and they
                                    only have £100 to pay off these bills. The ideal strategy is to pay £100 off the
                                    card with the highest interest rate, however the researchers found that people would
                                    allocate the money proportionally, with 80% of the value to card A and 20% to card
                                    B.

                                    What does this mean with savings accounts? Imagine you have two savings
                                    accounts,
                                    one for your holiday, one for a renovation for next year. As the
                                    renovation work is psychologically more important, you would
                                    allocate
                                    the proportion of funds based the relative importance. Say the
                                    renovation work was twice as important, then you would allocated 2/3
                                    to
                                    the renovation account and 1/3 to the holiday account. This means
                                    distributing funds across multiple accounts rather
                                    than consolidating them into one. While this method helps in
                                    achieving
                                    specific savings goals, it can also lead to suboptimal financial
                                    outcomes. Particularly when instant access account hold tiered
                                    interest
                                    rates.

                                <p class="text">"Don't put all your eggs in one basket" is a common
                                    phrase
                                    used by many investors, which depicts the propensity to spread risk
                                    across investments. This spread principle is often referred to as
                                    the
                                    <em>1/n heuristic</em> or naive diversification (Bernatzi and
                                    Thaler
                                    2001), which denotes the
                                    tendency to evenly allocate resources among the available options,
                                    regardless of whether the options are considered equal. Naive
                                    diversification has been demonstrated in consumer choices by
                                    Simonson
                                    (1990) who showed that consumers choices fit the 1/<em>N</em> heuristic when
                                    purchasing the same product n-times simultaneously versus
                                    sequentially
                                    on different days. This is also a common investment strategy, where investors will
                                    balance the values of same-day purchase of same-day investments (Gathergood et al.,
                                    2023). The 1/<em>N</em> heuristic is a shortcut mental strategy to reduce risk and
                                    uncertainty by spreading resources evenly across buckets (regardless of whether
                                    these buckets have the same value or weight).<br><br>

                                <p class="text">Data was simulated for 1,000,000 customers holding two or three tiered
                                    interest accounts (which is the smallest number of accounts that would require
                                    customers to consider how to allocate savings). Their savings was simulated using
                                    data from the Office for National Statistics' Wealth and Assets Survey which showed
                                    the median savings (across cash ISA and instant access accounts) at £12500
                                    [25<sup>th</sup> percentile = £2100; 75<sup>th</sup> percentile = £58500] and
                                    assumed to follow a log-normal distribution, where most individuals hold smaller
                                    balances.<br><br>

                                    approaches: optimal strategy,
                                    naive diversification or a matching heuristic approach. Optimal
                                    allocation was calculated by maximizing the expected return from placing
                                    all funds into one account. Naive diversification was computed as 1/<em>N</em> where
                                    N refers to the number of accounts. The matching
                                    heuristic was computed by randomly generating two or three numbers which were
                                    standardized to sum to one. This created five different groups for each individual;

                                    When customers are given the opportunity to spread savings across multiple
                                    tiered-interest saving products, they experience a significant loss of interest.

                                    The
                                    matching heuristic provides a marginally better outcome than a naive
                                    diversification, meaning if customers are forced to allocate funds across accounts,
                                    it would be in their interest to weight these allocations differently. However both
                                    naive diversification and matching incurred a financial harm to customers. The
                                    presence of multiple
                                    accounts provides an innocent but misdirected focus on how funds are allocated
                                    rather than the overall interest accrued. As a result many customers may lose out
                                    when using multiple instant access tiered savings accounts.
                                    Although these differences are statistically significant, at the individual level
                                    these likely do not encapsulate large savings, however at the population level, this
                                    could lead to large scale financial harms, particularly within those facing more
                                    financially hardship or lower financial capability. Let’s consider a hypothetical
                                    retail bank with 500, 000 customers, where 40% of these
                                    customers use tiered interest accounts. If each customer had an average balance of
                                    £5,500, the total savings would amount to £1.1 billion across all accounts. If 50%
                                    of
                                    these customers employed suboptimal strategies like naive diversification or
                                    matching
                                    heuristics, and lost an average of 9% interest, this translates into £49.5 million
                                    in
                                    lost
                                    interest annually to the bank’s customer base. A more conservative estimate of 10%
                                    of
                                    this hypothetical 500, 000 uses tiered interest account would incur a loss of £7.425
                                    million if only 10% of those consumers implement suboptimal strategies.

                                    Many customers will expect banks, rightly or wrongly, to act with
                                    integrity (doing what they say they will) and competence (doing things well).
                                    A side effect of the financial harm is the erosion of trust in the banking
                                    sector. Where customers are adopting mal-aligned allocation
                                    practices, the banks are able to benefit from the customer's inefficiency,
                                    heightening the asymmetry between the institution and the customer.
                                    This loss represents not just a missed opportunity for individual savers but a
                                    critical challenge for the bank itself. Customers who become aware of their lost
                                    potential earnings could lose trust in the bank, particularly in a financial
                                    landscape where consumers are increasingly informed and tech-savvy. This could lead
                                    to a rise in customer attrition as dissatisfied individuals shift their funds to
                                    competitors offering more transparent or optimized savings products.

                                    To mitigate this, banks must take a proactive approach in educating their customers.
                                    Providing tools such as personalized savings calculators, advisory services, and
                                    automated recommendations can help customers optimize their savings strategies and
                                    avoid the pitfalls of over-diversification.

                                    For retail banks, the main takeaway is perhaps that such incentive
                                    mechanisms should be revisited, in light of the UK's financial
                                    regulator
                                    (the Financial Conduct Authority) new legislation on "Consumer
                                    Duty",
                                    which seeks to minimize customer harms through four key outcomes:

                                This may impact retail banks across <strong>Product and Services</strong> as well as
                                <strong>Customer Understanding</strong>. Therefore, retail banks should proactively
                                communicate these insights to customers to help
                                them make informed decisions about their savings. Advisory services
                                could
                                encourage customers to optimize their savings strategy rather than
                                over-diversifying or using sub-optimal matching strategies that result
                                in
                                lower returns. If customers were to make this calculation and understand
                                the
                                impact, this may lost trust in their banks leading some customers to
                                shift
                                to other banks, which could reduce profitability. Alternatively banks could change
                                interest rates depending on how many accounts customers hold, i.e. using a diminishing
                                tiered interest rate system where greater balances incur lower interest rates for
                                customers with multiple accounts. Furthermore banks could look to help customers
                                allocate proportions of the balance for
                                different financial goals, finding a common ground between goal-setting and maximising
                                interest.

                                        in the design of tiered interest rate products when customers hold
                                        multiple accounts. While psychological mechanisms such as savings
                                        goals
                                        and the matching heuristic motivate consumers to allocate funds

                                        various accounts, this behavior can result in suboptimal financial
                                        outcomes, particularly in reduced interest earnings. Diversifying

                                        over two or three accounts leads to a notable loss of interest, with
                                        customers losing up to 11.39% compared to the optimal strategy of
                                        consolidating savings. For retail banks, this has important
