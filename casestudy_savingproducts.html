                                            In today's financial landscape, it's crucial for consumers to maintain
                                            savings as a buffer and to secure their financial goals. Several types of
                                            savings
                                            products can support this, including:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Regular saver savings account</li>
                                            <li>Instant/Easy access savings accounts (with flat interest rates)</li>
                                            <li>Tiered interest savings accounts (easy access accounts with
                                                differing
                                                rates)</li>
                                            <li>Fixed rate savings accounts</li>
                                        </ul><br>
                                        Each saving product have different benefits and drawbacks, however in this blog
                                        post we will focus on the <em>Tiered interest saving accounts</em>.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>
                                    <br>Tiered savings accounts offer varying interest rates based on the amount
                                    deposited. Most typically these accounts leverage higher interest rates for greater
                                    balances (though some exist that offer lower interest rates for higher balances).
                                    The more money you save, the higher the interest rate you can earn. This
                                    structure creates a powerful incentive for consumers to deposit as much as possible
                                    into a
                                    single account to reap the benefits of the highest interest tiers. The
                                    psychological mechanisms are incentive-based: higher deposits lead to higher
                                    returns, encouraging
                                    savers to consolidate funds to maximize interest earnings. The incremental
                                    increases in
                                    interest rates serve as a motivator for consumers to
                                    aim for the next tier, driving them to save more.<br>
                                    <p class="text">Tiered interest rates are designed to incentivize or
                                        disincentivize consumers to save more by offering different rates based
                                        on
                                        specific balance thresholds. For example, the table below shows a
                                        hypothetical tiered account where interest increases with higher
                                        balances.<br><br>

                                            £5000
                                            would yield
                                            an interest of £250. With long term savings products creating

                                            would produce £262.50 interest in the second year. This is because

                                <p class="text">Many retail banks offer customers the opportunity to
                                    allocate a given savings account for a financial goal. This has
                                    shown to
                                    be a significant motivator to help increase savings behaviour from
                                    consumers (Changwony, Campbell & Tabner, 2021; Soman & Zhao, 2011).
                                    Setting savings goals is valuable to customers
                                    because it provides a structured and organized approach to financial
                                    management. By clearly defining specific objectives, such as saving
                                    for
                                    a vacation, an emergency fund, or a major purchase, customers can
                                    better
                                    track their progress and stay motivated. Goal-setting features often
                                    come with tools and resources that help visualize the path to
                                    achieving
                                    these targets, such as automated transfers, progress tracking, and
                                    personalized savings plans. This not only enhances financial
                                    discipline
                                    but also helps customers build a stronger financial foundation by
                                    ensuring their money is purposefully allocated and their goals are
                                    systematically achieved by generating a reference position with clear
                                    trajectory through action planning (i.e. to save £600 in one month,
                                    means I need to save £150/week). Action planning along with evaluating
                                    consumption behaviour help customers to reach their savings goal (Patel,
                                    2018).

                                <p class="text">Although research shows that planning and goal-setting often
                                    lead to positive behavior changes, certain psychological mechanisms can
                                    reduce the effectiveness of these strategies. One of these is the problem of
                                    multiple competing financial categories.
                                    <br><br>
                                    When we create financial categories, we infer what is known as coherence. Where
                                    objects should not be applicable to more than one category. Though this seems quite
                                    straightforward and ideal, in financial contexts this has been empirically shown to
                                    lead individuals astray, and is referred to as
                                    <em>mental accounting</em>. Mental accounting is a psychological
                                    approach to monitoring resources identified by Richard Thaler (1999)
                                    where people categorise spendings for set categories such as bills
                                    (utilities), entertainment, petrol and so forth. Though this can be
                                    beneficial
                                    in certain situations by enabling goal-directed behaviour, it
                                    neglects
                                    the fungibility of money, £100 for fuel can just as easily pay for £100 of food.
                                    This can lead many people to mistakenly misallocate their resources.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In savings context, this could lead to a situation where a customer categorises
                                    their saving goals into discrete baskets and therefore distribute their funds
                                    according to some value or
                                    assigned weight. This means that the customer is no longer focused on the optimal
                                    returns in interest, but in the relative proportion that should be
                                    allocated to each pot and their respective interest earnt. This shift in attention
                                    means customers will
                                    resort to heuristics to allocate their savings, which are likely to be sub-optimal.

                                <h3 class="subtitle">The Matching Heuristic</h3>
                                <p class="text"> When customers are faced with multiple
                                    baskets, many individuals engage in a matching heuristic (Bernatzi &
                                    Thaler, 2001; Gathergood et al., 2019). The matching heuristic is a
                                    diversification principle, where they allocate resources matched to
                                    the
                                    percentage of the weight of their carchological goals.
                                    What does this mean in practice? Imagine you have two savings
                                    accounts,
                                    one for your holiday, one for a renovation for next year. As the
                                    renovation work is psychologically more important, you would
                                    allocate
                                    the proportion of funds based the relative importance. Say the
                                    renovation work was twice as important, then you would allocated 2/3
                                    to
                                    the renovation account and 1/3 to the holiday account. This means
                                    distributing funds across multiple accounts rather
                                    than consolidating them into one. While this method helps in
                                    achieving
                                    specific savings goals, it can also lead to suboptimal financial
                                    outcomes. Particularly when instant access account hold tiered
                                    interest
                                    rates.

                                    used by many investors, which depicts the propensity to spread risk
                                    across investments. This spread principle is often referred to as
                                    the
                                    <em>1/n heuristic</em> or niaive diversification (Bernatzi and
                                    Thaler
                                    2001), which denotes the
                                    tendency to evenly allocate resources among the available options,

                                    (1990) who showed that consumers choices fit the 1/n hueristic when

                                    demonstrated a significant reduction in interest compared to the

                                    group. A family-wise analysis demonstrated significant lost interest
                                    for

                                    to

                                    for diversification and matching was shown to be statistically
                                    significant using the linearHypothesis function from the car package

                                    accounts was shown to demonstrate a significant loss of interest.
                                    Diversification for two accounts was shown to hold an estimated loss
                                    of
                                    7.61% ;(&beta; = -0.079, <em>p</em> &lt; .001) whilst diversifying
                                    balances over three accounts showed further loss at 11.39% (&beta; =
                                    -0.12, <em>p</em> &lt; .001). The use of the matching heuristic
                                    demonstrates a better outcome but still a net loss of interest, with
                                    individuals matching across two accounts at 5.99% (&beta; = -0.06,
                                    <em>p</em> &lt; .001) and those with
                                    three accounts at 9.12% (&beta; = -0.10, <em>p</em> &lt; .001).

                                </h3>
                                <p class="text">
                                    For many customers the premise is that tiered interest rates in fact
                                    hurt your financial position, when you are holding more than one
                                    account. There may be many psychological incentives that could be at
                                    play including psychological control, where spreading more funds
                                    across
                                    accounts helps customers to feel they have more control over their
                                    spending. However the alternative may be true, where a recent study
                                    in
                                    Buy Now Pay Later (Maesen & Ang, 2024) demonstrated that the Buy Now
                                    Pay
                                    Later products reduces subjective financial constraints, leading the
                                    propensity to spending. A similar mechanism may be the case with
                                    reduced
                                    financial constriants maked customers feel more in control and
                                    tradeoff
                                    the lost interest for psychological control.
                                    account utilises tiered interest rates, and to allocate proportions
                                    of
                                    the balance to goals rather than seperate accounts.

                                    For retail banks, the main takeaway is perhaps that such incentive
                                    mechanisms should be revisited, in light of the UK's financial
                                    regulator
                                    (the Financial Conduct Authority) new legislation on "Consumer
                                    Duty",
                                    which seeks to minimise customer harms through four key outcomes:
                                <ul style="list-style-type:square; margin-left: 2rem">
                                    <li>Price and fair value</li>
                                    <li>Product and Services</li>
                                    <li>Customer understanding</li>
                                    <li>Customer support</li>
                                </ul><br>
                                This may impact retail banks across "Product and Services" as well as
                                "Customer Understanding". Therefore retail banks should proactively
                                communicate these insights to customers to help
                                them make informed decisions about their savings. Advisory services
                                could
                                encourage customers to optimize their savings strategy rather than
                                over-diversifying or using sub-optimal matching strategies that result
                                in
                                lower returns. If customers were to make this calculation and understand
                                the
                                impact, this may lost trust in their banks leading some customers to
                                shift
                                to other banks, which could reduce profitability.

                                        The findings from this simulated experiment highlight a significant
                                        flaw
                                        in the design of tiered interest rate products when customers hold
                                        multiple accounts. While psychological mechanisms such as savings
                                        goals
                                        and the matching heuristic motivate consumers to allocate funds
                                        across
                                        various accounts, this behavior can result in suboptimal financial
                                        outcomes, particularly in reduced interest earnings. Diversifying
                                        funds
                                        over two or three accounts leads to a notable loss of interest, with
                                        customers losing up to 11.39% compared to the optimal strategy of
                                        consolidating savings. For retail banks, this has important
                                        implications
                                        in terms of customer education and product design, especially in
                                        light
                                        of new regulations such as the FCA's "Consumer Duty" initiative.
                                        Banks
                                        should reconsider how they communicate the impact of diversification
                                        and
                                        matching strategies on interest earnings to ensure transparency and
